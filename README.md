Twitter-like app

This app is a sort of a mix between Twitter and Instagram, in which users can choose to post and view 'Fweets',
which are purely text-based or images with captions, just like on Instagram.

The app requires registering and signing in with a username and a password.
Once signed in, users can choose to go to their profile page, where they can change their profile picture from
the default one to any picture of their liking from their gallery.
Users are also able to navigate to the 'Search' screen, where they can see other users to follow, so that their
timeline is populated by posts by those users. These posts can be liked and commented on.
Posting Fweets and images is a simple process, managed from the upload screen.

Feel free to create an account and post some fun stuff on here!
